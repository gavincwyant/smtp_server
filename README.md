SMTP sever written in C for the purpose of learning the protocol. This is a barebones implementation. The system architecture is that of one server and two concurrent clients. Server runs -> Client A runs and connects to server via tcp-> Client A sends email to Client B via SMTP -> Client B runs and connects to server via tcp and retrieves the email (if it exists, which it always does in our case). email is sent over the same socket but with a simple HTTP get request to pull the message.
